A common situation is during modeling to unmarshall a block's properties as input or output pins for an action in an activity diagram. This plugin helps for this case: 

- Either add an input pin to an action, set the type of the input pin to the block, and press the button, or
- Select an action and also select the block in the tree and press the button

The plugin allows you to select the required properties and add create the corresponding input or output pins.
